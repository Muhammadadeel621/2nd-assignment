    <h1>NEWS OF COMPUTER SCIENCE</h1>
    <h1 id="news1">NEWS 1</h1>
    <p>Computer Science Education is an interdisciplinary field: it is of course about the
        teaching and learning of computer science but it’s also about all the areas that
        impact on computer science – philosophy, psychology, linguistics, natural sciences,
        and mathematics – and how they intersect with the theory and practice of education.
        In comparison to its sister fields of science education and mathematics education
        it is a much younger area: computers were only built from around the 1940s
        although computation has been around for centuries (Tedre, 2014).
        The other main difference between science education and maths education
        is that it has primarily only been taught at university level until recently, with some
        notable exceptions (Israel and Poland, for example; and the UK in the 1980s).
        We have seen computer science in the curriculum from age 14 or age 16 in a few
        countries for a few decades, but always as an elective subject.

        This change in the curriculum was rapid and many teachers are still adapting to the new
        content. As computer science includes computer programming, this is a skill that can
        take many years to master completely. Teachers have not had the luxury of a few years
        to master this.  In fact much of the literature in computer science education relates
        to the learning of programming and the difficulties therein; thus teacher preparation
        to teach computer science is a very significant factor in the success of the new
        curriculum. We are fortunate to have a large community of practice in Computing
        At School in which teachers work together to support each other. More about this 
        in the post about CAS London

        Subsequent to the change in curriculum there is much that we do not know about
        exactly how young children learn aspects of computer science. Again looking at 
        the literature of science education and mathematics education there is acres of
        research in these subjects because they have always been taught in school, as 
        long as we have had school. We do not have this history in computer science education
