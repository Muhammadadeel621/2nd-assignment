        ICC Chief Executive Manu Sawhney said: “Both the Cricket Committee and Chief Executives
        Committee supported the approach of ranking teams based on completed matches
        and points earned as this reflects their performance and doesn’t disadvantage
        teams that have been unable to compete all of their matches through no fault of
        their own.“We explored a whole range of options, but our Members felt strongly
        that we should proceed as planned with the first ever World Test Championship Final
        in June next year.”

        ICC CEO Manu Sawhney said: “Moving the ICC Women’s T20 World Cup to 2023 makes
        perfect sense on a number of levels. Firstly, it will provide a better workload
        balance for players giving them the best possible opportunity to perform to the
        highest levels on a global stage. Secondly, we can continue to build the momentum
        around the women’s game through 2022 and into 2023. We are committed to fueling
        the growth of the women’s game and today’s decision enables us to do that over 
        the longer term.”

        n case of exceptional circumstances, a Member Board could apply to the ICC to allow
        a player under the age of 15 to play for them. This could include where the player’s
        playing experience and mental development and wellbeing demonstrates that they would
        be capable of coping with the demands of international cricket.An updated World Test
        Championship can be found here.For a video explaining the changes to the ICC World Test
        Championship points system by Geoff Allardice, ICC General Manager - Cricket refer to
