        On October 29, Pakistan reported over 1,000 coronavirus cases â€” the first time since
        July, when it got the pandemic pretty much under control. In the last six days,
        the South Asian country has registered around 12,000 cases, bringing the total 
        COVID-19 infections to 365,927 and 7,248 related deaths.Health experts say the country
        is in the grip of a second coronavirus wave, which could prove to be more lethal than
        the first wave.

        Large gatherings are making the virus transmission easier. I am not only talking 
        about coronavirus; even the flu cases are rising. If a patient, who is already 
        infected with other viruses, catches coronavirus, his survival chances are very low.
        That is why this second coronavirus wave is more dangerous, more lethal," Tipu Sultan,
        former president of the Pakistan Medical Association, told DW.

        Arsalan Mahmood of the Young Doctors Association urges the government to ramp up
        coronavirus tests. "We still don't have the true picture of the pandemic. We are a 
        country of 220 million people and we are not testing enough. We need to test at
        least 1 million people per day. We cannot formulate a proper COVID-19 policy without 
        it," he told DW.
